# Python Dev Portfolio

This repository collects my Python practice projects.  
I am learning and improving my skills step by step, and I use this space to keep my code clean, organized, and growing.

Inside this portfolio you will find:
- basic Python exercises  
- data structures and algorithms practice  
- automation scripts  
- web requests and scraping  
- FastAPI learning projects  
- Selenium tasks  
- small real-life mini apps  

I am still learning, so the code may not be perfect.  
I update and improve the projects as I grow.  
Feedback, suggestions, and better solutions are always welcome.
